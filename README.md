Mega City Cab System
The Mega City Cab project aims to automate the booking and management processes for the company, 
eliminating inefficiencies and errors from the current manual system. This new system will streamline operations,
improve customer booking experiences, and manage driver and vehicle details effectively.

Key features of the system :

Customer Registration & Booking Management: Allows customers to easily register, book rides, and track booking details.

Invoice Generation: Automates the calculation of fares, taxes, and discounts.

Vehicle Management: Stores and manages vehicle information securely.

User-Friendly Interface: A menu-driven interface ensures an intuitive experience for both customers and staff.

The system is developed in Java and uses text files for data storage, offering a simple yet efficient way to manage customer, 
booking, and driver data. Secure authentication and validation processes will ensure that sensitive information remains protected. 
The system is designed to handle multiple bookings simultaneously and includes error handling to minimize issues.
